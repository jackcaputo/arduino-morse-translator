# Description
This project was designed to be used with the Arduino Uno. It takes user text input through the Serial Moniter interface and translates it to Morse Code, both audibly (via speaker) and visually (via LED). Note that it uses the library ```CWLibrary``` which was found on the Arduino IDE, which itself references the library's GitHub. The GitHub for the library can be found in the following section or at the top of the code itself.

## Links to Libraries Used
[```CWLibrary```](https://github.com/bobboteck/CWLibrary/tree/master): Does the heavy lifting for converting characters/words to Morse Code

## Other
This was a small, individual project created for a circuits course at university. It only includes the one file that I used for this project.
I am only using GitHub as a clean way to link my code to others reviewing my work.
